# Beerka
An ASP.NET Core Web API, Web Application and Desktop Application for a store.
This was a university assignment at Eötvös Loránd University.

**Important:**
* Before running, do not forget to set the connection string in the *appsettings.json* in *Beerka.Web* and *Beerka.WebAPI* projects!

**Note:**
* The main purpose of the assignment was to implement the expected functionality.
* There was no emphasis on looks, hence the basic look of the web and desktop applications.

**Testing:**
* A valid username/password combination for the desktop application is `test`/`test`.
* To check the paging/listing functionality, select the *Beers* page, as that page has a lot of (generated) entries.

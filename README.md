# Beerka
An ASP.NET Core Web API, Web Application and Desktop Application for a store.
This was a University assignment at Eötvös Loránd University.

Important:
When trying out, do not forget to set the connection string in the 'appsettings.json' in 'Beerka.Web' and 'Beerka.WebAPI'!

Note:
The main purpose of the assignment was to implement the expected functionality.
There was no emphasis on looks, hence the basic look of the web and desktop applications.

Testing:
A valid username/password combination for the desktop application is 'test'/'test' (without the single quotes).
To check the paging/listing functionality, select the 'Beers' page, as that page has a lot of (generated) entries in the default database.
